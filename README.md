# WebRTC Signalling Server

A spring alternative for the signaling server implementation of a simple VoIP application.
The front end (and node signalling server implementation) can be found
[here](https://github.com/H3AR7B3A7/EarlyAngularProjects/tree/master/voipExample).

## WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a free and open-source project providing web browsers and mobile applications
with real-time communication (RTC) via simple application programming interfaces (APIs).
It allows audio and video communication to work inside web pages by allowing direct peer-to-peer communication,
eliminating the need to install plugins or download native apps.[3] Supported by Apple, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla,
and Opera, WebRTC specifications have been published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

According to the webrtc.org website, the purpose of the project is to "enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be
developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them all to communicate via a common set of protocols".


We can find a slightly more advanced example of a Spring signalling server
